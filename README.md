# TextAdventure

If you want to enable debug mode (enables no initial routine and some debug commands) make sure to set
the enviroment variable `debug` or modify the code to your needs!


This TextAdventure provides at this point in time one level **GroundFloorLevel**

You are in the hallway of a datacenter which has been hacked. You have to help to fix the problem,
because all sysadmins have left the building.

The gameplay will consist of many puzzles and tasks to solve and eventually get the datacenter up and running again.


*Disclaimer*: at this point in time no puzzle has been implemented so far!


### Commands

Just use the ingame `help` command to see a list of commands with their explanation and usage guide.
